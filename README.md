# TaskTracker(Python)
A command-line task tracking application built in Python that allows users to create, view, and update tasks with persistent storage using a local JSON file. The project was designed to strengthen core software engineering skills, including command-line interface design, file system interaction, and structured data management.

The application parses user input via command-line arguments, performs CRUD-style operations on tasks, and maintains task state across executions. Each task includes a unique identifier, status, and creation/update timestamps, demonstrating practical use of data structures and state management without relying on external libraries.

This project emphasizes clean, readable code and incremental feature development, and reflects real-world patterns used in lightweight CLI tools. It serves as a foundation for more advanced applications involving automation, tooling, and backend logic.
